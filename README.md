#Gulp Zero

Same gulp taste. Zero sugar. A gulp recipe.

##What the heck is this?

A low-calorie flavour gulp recipe.

##No, seriously?

Gulp Zero is a starting point for projects using the gulp build system. I've used a lot of gulp systems over the past few months, and they often come in two flavours: stripped or bloated. So I decided to create my own.

#Features
- Compiles Sass
- Minifies css
- Browserify (lets you `require` packages installed via npm and bundles your JavaScript)
- Minifies JS
- Autoprefixer (adds vendor prefixes so you don't have to)
- Swig to HTML
- Browser reload on saved changes
- Spins up local server

#Getting started

If you would like to use this on a project, simply run:

    git clone https://github.com/realph/gulp-zero.git gulp-zero
    cd gulp-zero
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install
    gulp

It's that simple!
